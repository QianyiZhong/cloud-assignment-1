==================

This homework was done by Qianyi Zhong(qz2198) and  Weixin Wu (ww2383). 

We realized the realtime tweets fetching and store the tweets into Amazon SimpleDB in TwitterGet2.java.

We can get the markers of location of the tweets by click "count", and the TwittMap also supports heatmap.

We predifined some keywords, and we can select keyword for query from the downlist.

The webpage will refreshed by every one minites which will let the new tweets get in.

Also we realized Elastic Beanstalk in the forlder Beanstalk.
